# React / Redux toolkit

A minimal starter toolkit for projects based on React and Redux and some optional dependencies.

Based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- Basic Redux boilerplate: folder structure, store creation, middlewares ([`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) and [`redux-logger`](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger)).
- Includes v4 of [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v4/README.md);
- Includes [`ramda`](http://ramdajs.com/) for utils.
